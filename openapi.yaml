x-notes: |
  - To enforce role-based access control, validate JWT and check `role` claim.
  - All admin endpoints must return 403 if user is authenticated but not admin.
  - Duplicate daily check-in prevention should return 409 Conflict.
  - Password reset endpoint should initiate email flow; token exchange endpoint
    can be added under `/auth/password-reset/confirm` if desired.
  - Consider adding pagination (limit/offset) for list endpoints.
